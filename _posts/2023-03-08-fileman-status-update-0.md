fileman is a file manager application for Android. It's core feature set is:
* switching tabs
* listing files and directories
* viewing files
* file/directory operations (rename, delete, move, copy)

fileman is developing using the [tab manifesto]({% link _posts/2023-03-02-the-tab-manifesto.md %}). Below are mockups of two screens: the screen shown when a new tab is opened, and the explorer screen, listing the files and/or directories in a directory.

{% include image.html url="/assets/fileman-status-update-0/mockup-2.png" description="Final Mockup" %}


I have to decided to go with the final mockup. I have currently implemented all but the last of the core feature set. The final feature involves scheduling operations and I am figuring out how to implement that.

The next status update will include the release of the application, a deep dive of how I've implemented the core feature set and the features I would like to implement next.
